# CAD Projects

This is a collection of design & mechanical engineering projects that I've worked on throughout my first two years at Northwestern University. This includes a satellite design honed through Python simulations and nTopology, design projects on commerical goods, and my design project on an original product helping a person with disabilites pick up cups and jars. Please take a look at my work!
