# CAD Projects

This is a collection of design & mechanical engineering projects that I've worked on throughout my first two years at Northwestern University. This includes an RC plane design, satellite design honed through Python simulations and nTopology, design projects on commercial goods, and my design project on an original product helping a person with disabilites pick up cups and jars. Please take a look at my work!

# RC Airplane Assembly

I contributed to making a 3D-printed Graphene RC plane wing assembly, modeled after the [Eppler 68 rib](http://airfoiltools.com/airfoil/details?airfoil=e68-il), a low Reynolds number rib, and adjusting the camber angle and thickness in OnShape to hone our design. We used the [Airfoil database](http://airfoiltools.com/search/index?MAirfoilSearchForm%5BtextSearch%5D=epler&MAirfoilSearchForm%5BmaxThickness%5D=&MAirfoilSearchForm%5BminThickness%5D=&MAirfoilSearchForm%5BmaxCamber%5D=&MAirfoilSearchForm%5BminCamber%5D=&MAirfoilSearchForm%5Bgrp%5D=&MAirfoilSearchForm%5Bsort%5D=1&yt0=Search) to determine the best shape for the singular rib, and then used a linear pattern to assemble it into a wing. Below are a couple of graphics of the work.

# Product Design

## SDO

### Slap Down Opener

This product was created for a person with mobility disabilites a. This was done in collaboration with three other members and the Shirley Ryan Ability Lab(SRAL). The budget for this project was 10 weeks and $100, and we presented our final findings at a conference at the end of the term.

# DSGN321 Projects

In one of my classes at Northwestern, I created a detergent bottle, mouse, shovel, and many more beyond the scope of this GitHub page. I fooled a lot with rendering, and this is done using surface modeling for the most part.
