# CAD Projects

This is a collection of design & mechanical engineering projects that I've worked on throughout my first two years at Northwestern University. This includes a satellite design honed through Python simulations and nTopology, design projects on commercial goods, and my design project on an original product helping a person with disabilites pick up cups and jars. Please take a look at my work!

### Slap Down Opener

This product was created for a person with mobility disabilites a. This was done in collaboration with three other members and the Shirley Ryan Ability Lab(SRAL). The budget for this project was 10 weeks and $100, and we presented our final findings at a conference at the end of the term.

# DSGN321

In one of my classes at Northwestern, I created a detergent bottle, mouse, shovel, and many more beyond the scope of this GitHub page. I fooled a lot with rendering, and this is done using surface modeling for the most part.
